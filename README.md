Hyperkube Images for Rancher
============================

Rancher 2.0 is built off of Kubernetes upstream hyperkube images (gcr/google_containers/hyperkube).  This repo repackages the hyperkube images for Rancher.

There is one branch per minor release of Kubernetes.  For example v1.8, v1.9, v1.10, etc.
